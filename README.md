# Demalvertising: Enhanced Detection and Mitigation of Malvertising on Android Devices

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust solution to detect and mitigate the threat of malvertising, which involves the injection of malware into legitimate web advertisements, particularly on Android devices. The primary goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to create an efficient and adaptive system for identifying and preventing malvertising campaigns.
